On frontend side I used ReactJs with typescript because which react we can create components, 
wich makes us save a lof of time and typescript check the types in development environment, 
so i help us a lot in which type of data we have to pass to some function. 
Now, on backend side my friend decided to use java because he already had create API with Spring Boot
and now he learned more about security with Spring.
