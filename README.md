#### Front-end: @LuizMeraki

On the Front-end side, first of all, I used these technologies because they are part of my Front-end stack, 
but I used ReactJs and TypeScript because with React I can create components, 
wich makes us save a lof of time and TypeScript check the types in development environment so,
it helps us a lot in which type of data we have to pass to some function and prevent lot of possible errors. 

Developing this app I learned more about authorization using token, more about React syntax, I improved my
code writting and problem solutions.

#### Back-end: @luiz7727

Now, on Back-end side my friend decided to use java because he already had create API with Spring Boot
and now he learned more about security with Spring.
