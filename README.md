#### Front-end: @LuizMeraki

On frontend side I used ReactJs with typescript because which react we can create components, 
wich makes us save a lof of time and typescript check the types in development environment, 
so it helps us a lot in which type of data we have to pass to some function for example. 

#### Back-end: @luiz7727

Now, on backend side my friend decided to use java because he already had create API with Spring Boot
and now he learned more about security with Spring.
